# Project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Here, I present you not only a solution for 8x8 matrix, but to any matrix that is more or equal to 4. 
There is also a very neat GUI, that shows not only one solution, but all solutions and also elapsed time.

### Prerequisites
